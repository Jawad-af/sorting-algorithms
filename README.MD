** PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE **

Some algorithms if not all, would have a Profiler.h file included. This file is provided from our faculty to analyize the performance of the algorithms.
** I do not know if I have the permission to provide such a file as an open source **

- If you want to run the code you have to delete the statements that are related to the Profiler.
- If you want to test the performance of your algorithm, please contact me.
